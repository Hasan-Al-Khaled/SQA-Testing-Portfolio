Python Programming for SQA Engineers

## What I Accomplished Today

### Environment Setup
- Python 3.11+ installation with proper PATH configuration
- PyCharm IDE setup for professional development
- Essential automation libraries installed

### Python Skills Developed
- Variables and data types for test automation
- Control structures (if/else, loops) with testing context
- Functions for reusable test operations
- Exception handling for robust automation
- File operations (JSON, Excel) for test data management

### Object-Oriented Programming
- Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
- Base classes with inheritance
- Encapsulation and separation of concerns

### Selenium WebDriver Integration
- Browser automation setup
- WebDriver manager for automatic driver handling
- First successful automation script (Google search)

### Framework Architecture
- Professional project structure
- Configuration management system
- Utility classes for common operations
- Test data handling capabilities

## Key Files Created
- `python_basics.py` - Core Python concepts practice
- `login_page.py` - Page Object Model example
- `first_selenium_test.py` - First automation script
- `config.json` - Configuration management
- Complete framework structure

## Skills Gained
- Python programming fundamentals
- Selenium WebDriver automation
- Framework architecture design
- File handling and data management
- Object-oriented programming concepts

## Next Steps
 Advanced Python collections, exception handling, and framework enhancement
